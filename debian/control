Description: VHDL compiler/simulator using GCC technology
 (Description from the GHDL home page <http://ghdl.free.fr>):
 .
 GHDL is a VHDL simulator, using the GCC technology.
 .
 VHDL is a language standardized by the IEEE, intended for developing
 electronic systems.
 .
 GHDL implements the VHDL language according to the IEEE 1076-1987 or
 the IEEE 1076-1993 standard. GHDL compiles VHDL files and creates a
 binary which simulates (or executes) your design.
 .
 GHDL does not do synthesis: it cannot translate your design into a
 netlist.
